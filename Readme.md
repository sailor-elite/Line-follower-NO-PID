# Line Follower NO PID

#### The main objective of this project is to develop a line-following robot capable of making 90-degree turns without the use of PID control. A secondary goal is to compare the performance of this "NO PID" solution with a similar robot that uses PID control. This comparison will be made under various conditions to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

# Dependencies
